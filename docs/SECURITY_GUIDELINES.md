# Security Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive security guidelines for developers working on this project. Following these guidelines helps ensure the security and integrity of our application and data.

## Environment Variables and Secrets Management

### ✅ DO:

- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Store secrets in `.env` files (never commit these to version control)
- Use `.env.example` or `.env.template` for documentation
- Implement proper secret rotation
- Use different secrets for different environments

### ❌ DON'T:

- Hardcode secrets, passwords, or API keys in source code
- Commit `.env` files to version control
- Use the same secrets across different environments
- Share secrets in chat, email, or documentation
- Use weak or predictable secrets

### Environment File Structure:

```
.env                    # Production environment (never commit)
.env.development        # Development environment (never commit)
.env.test              # Test environment (never commit)
.env.example           # Example configuration (safe to commit)
env.template           # Template for environment setup (safe to commit)
```

## Database Security

### ✅ DO:

- Use environment variables for database credentials
- Implement connection pooling
- Use least privilege principle for database users
- Validate all user inputs before database queries
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper error handling without exposing system details

### ❌ DON'T:

- Hardcode database passwords in scripts or code
- Use root/admin database users for application connections
- Expose database connection details in error messages
- Allow direct database access from client-side code

## Authentication and Authorization

### ✅ DO:

- Implement proper JWT token management
- Use secure password hashing (bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds)
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Validate tokens on every protected request
- Implement proper session management
- Use HTTPS in production

### ❌ DON'T:

- Store passwords in plain text
- Use weak password policies
- Trust client-side validation alone
- Expose user details in error messages
- Use predictable JWT secrets

## Input Validation and Sanitization

### ✅ DO:

- Validate all user inputs on both client and server side
- Sanitize data before storing in database
- Use proper validation libraries (Zod, Joi, etc.)
- Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Log security-relevant events

### ❌ DON'T:

- Trust user input without validation
- Allow HTML/script injection
- Expose internal system information in error messages
- Log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, etc.)

## API Security

### ✅ DO:

- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate and sanitize all API inputs
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Implement request logging for security monitoring

### ❌ DON'T:

- Allow unrestricted CORS access
- Expose internal API endpoints without authentication
- Return sensitive information in API responses
- Allow unlimited API requests

## File Upload Security

### ✅ DO:

- Validate file types and sizes
- Store uploaded files outside web root when possible
- Implement virus scanning for uploaded files
- Use secure file naming conventions
- Implement proper access controls for uploaded files

### ❌ DON'T:

- Allow execution of uploaded files
- Trust file extensions alone for validation
- Store files in publicly accessible directories without proper controls
- Allow unlimited file uploads

## Testing Security

### ✅ DO:

- Use separate test databases
- Use test-specific secrets and credentials
- Mock external services in tests
- Test security features thoroughly
- Use environment variables for test configuration

### ❌ DON'T:

- Use production databases for testing
- Use production secrets in test code
- Skip security-related tests
- Expose test credentials in production builds

## Development Workflow Security

### ✅ DO:

- Review code for security issues before merging
- Use automated security scanning tools
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow secure coding practices
- Document security decisions and configurations

### ❌ DON'T:

- Skip security reviews for "quick fixes"
- Ignore security warnings from tools
- Use outdated or vulnerable dependencies
- Bypass security measures for convenience

## Incident Response

### ✅ DO:

- Report security issues immediately
- Document security incidents
- Implement fixes promptly
- Communicate with stakeholders appropriately
- Learn from security incidents

### ❌ DON'T:

- Hide or ignore security issues
- Delay fixing critical vulnerabilities
- Share incident details publicly without approval
- Blame individuals for security issues
